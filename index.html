        <h1>Common English Grammar Mistakes and How to Fix Them</h1>
        <p>
            The English language is well known for being the language of international communication in the modern world – and
            wherever you originate from, and whatever native tongue you speak, it’s likely that learning English will be invaluable
            in both your personal and professional lives. Of course, the English language frequently frustrates new learners with
            various grammatical hurdles and stumbling blocks.

            <li>COMMON ENGLISH GRAMMAR MISTAKES</li>
            <p>Present tenses in English are used to talk about the present, the future and to summarise a book, film or play when
            telling a story in the present tense.</p>
            <p>There are four present tense forms in the English language.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Present Simple: I Work</li>
                <li>Present Continuous: I am Working</li>
                <li>Present Perfect: I have worked</li>
                <li>Present perfect continuous: I have been working</li>
            </ul>
            <b><p>Rules:</p></b>
            <p>You can use the past tense to talk about events or situations that have finished. You can also use past tense in English
            to talk about long-standing events and situations that have already happened in the past.</p>
            <p>For example: When I was a young child, I lived in the countryside.</p>
            <p>Here are some frequently used examples of verbs in past simple: are, was, were and went.</p>
            <li>How To Avoid the Overuse of Adverbs</li>
            <p>Adverbs are a varied class of words that work in many different ways to express many different kinds of meaning.</p>
            
            <p>This can make adverbs a useful word group. You should, however, avoid overusing these words to describe actions and
            events.</p>
            
            <p>The most commonly overused adverbs are manner adverbs, this particular type of adverb modifies the verb.</p>
            <i><p>For example:</p></i>
            <p>The curtain opened quickly, and Ben came slowly into the room. He saw Emma looking flirtatiously with Jack and walked
            over to her aggressively. ‘Why are you here?’ he screamed angrily.</p>
            <i><p>Here is the same extract with the manner verbs highlighted:</p></i>
